# Preface

This book originated while teaching Advanced Optical Imaging in a master course applied physics at Delft University of Technology in 2021. In that course we were using the well known work *Introduction to Fourier Optics* from Goodman. This book has been the standard work for many years. However, while teaching from this book we observed that it was quite old with many references to analog techniques. Moreover, in our opinion there can be substantial improvements in the notations and explanations of some Fourier optics principles. Also the field of optical imaging has strongly evolved in the direction of computational optics, something that is not well supported in the book.   

The aim of this book is to bring together the most important aspects of Fourier optics, improve the notation, and use new tools for the visualization of Fourier optics concepts. The book is greatly indebted to other great pieces of work

- *Mathematical Foundations of Imaging, Tomography and Wavefield Inversion*, by Anthony Devaney   

For notation we have chosen to use the physics convention for the complex number $i=\sqrt{-1}$ instead of $j$. However, to enhance the distinction between $x$ components of wavevectors and spatial frequencies we use the electrical engineering notation where I write $2\pi f_x$ instead of $k_x$. In addition, the use of $f_x$ instead of $k_x$ avoids the addition of pre-factors in the inverse Fourier transform.
